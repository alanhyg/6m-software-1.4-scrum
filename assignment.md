## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each question:

Question 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. n your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
Scrum benefits by fostering collaboration, flexibility and efficiency. With work divided into 
short sprints, it allows teams to focus on consistent progress. This ensures consistent value 
and reduces errors by breaking projects into manageable chunks. It promotes clear communication 
through daily meetings, where team members share and discuss problems. 

This transparency helps identify and address issues, keeping the team focused on what needs to 
be done. Reviews at the end of each sprint help ensure that work meets target and see if 
there's anything that needs to be adjusted. 

By using the Product Backlog to prioritize tasks, Scrum ensures that the team is always working 
on the most vital and valuable features. This prevents the team from getting sidetracked by less 
important tasks, optimizing resource allocation and boosting productivity.

Through Sprint Retrospectives, teams can reflect on what went well and what needs to be adjusted, 
leading to better processes and efficiency over time.

Question 2:
Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

```
As a reader, I want to preview a book, so that I can make an informed decision

As a reader, I want to review a book, so that I can share my opinion with other potential readers

As a reader, I want to view my reading history, so that I can see what I read previously.

As a reader, I want to renew a book before it is due, so that I can keep the book longer.

As a reader, I want to request books that are not added in the libraty, so that I can read books that are not available

As a user, I want to manage my current book loans, so that I can see due dates and renew books if needed

As a user, I want to receive a notification when a reserved book becomes available, so that I can borrow the book as soon as possible

As a user, I want to search for a book, so that I can find the book based on a genre or author's name

As a user, I want to give feedback, so that I can suggest improvements or address a concern

As a user, I want to create a reading list, so that I can view the books I want to read when I visit the library
```

Question 3: 
Define [Acceptance Criteria](https://resources.scrumalliance.org/Article/need-know-acceptance-criteria) for 3 to 5 user stories out of the 10 user stories you have defined.

```
Given that I'm a member who borrowed a book
- When I click "Extend date" on the website
- Then the due date to return the book will be extended by 2 weeks

Given that I'm a reader who wants to review a book
- When I click "Review" on the book summary page
- Then the website will prompt me for my rating and comment

Given that I'm a user who wants to borrow the book once it is available
- When I click "Reserve" on the book detail page
- Then the website will notify me via email or text message as soon as it becomes available
